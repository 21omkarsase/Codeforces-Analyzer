Note If anyone contributes to this repository, then the changes will not be reflected in your local repository. For that:

9. Setup a reference(remote) to the original repository to get all the changes from the remote.

   git remote add upstream https://git@github.com:21omkarsase/Codeforces-Visualizer.git

10. Check the remotes for this repository.

git remote -v

11. Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits.

git fetch upstream

12. Make sure that you're on your main branch.

git merge upstream/main
